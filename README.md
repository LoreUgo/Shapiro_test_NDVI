# Shapiro_test_NDVI
Assessing if the data we gathered about NDVI follow a normal distribution or not

When we collect data, we need to assess whether it follows a normal distribution if we want to perform tests like t-tests and ANOVA or infer missing values through Bayesian statistics.
The code checks the distribution of the data of the data sample I collected about NDVI.
